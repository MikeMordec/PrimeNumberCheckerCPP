Simple C++ program to check if a given integer is prime or not.

Prime Number Checker (C++)

This repository contains a simple C++ program that checks whether a given integer is a prime number or not.
Description

This C++ program prompts the user to enter a positive integer greater than 1 and then determines whether the entered number is a prime number or not. It employs a basic algorithm to check for divisibility by iterating through numbers from 2 to the square root of the entered number.
Features

    User-friendly interface: Simply enter a positive integer, and the program will determine whether it's prime or not.
    Efficient algorithm: The program utilizes an efficient algorithm to check for prime numbers, reducing unnecessary iterations.
    Error handling: Handles cases where the user enters invalid input or a number less than or equal to 1.

Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/PrimeNumberCheckerCPP.git

Navigate to the cloned directory:

bash

cd PrimeNumberCheckerCPP

Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example, using g++:

bash

g++ pe5_6.cpp -o PrimeNumberChecker

Run the compiled executable:

bash

./PrimeNumberChecker

Follow the on-screen instructions to enter a positive integer, and the program will display whether it's prime or not.
